            <h2>WazirX freezes $3 million in USDT nearly 7 months after cyberattack</h2>
            <p>Embattled crypto platform WazirX announced that it has frozen the first tranche of stolen virtual digital assets (VDAs) worth $3 million in USDT.
 
This comes nearly seven months after an alleged security breach led to the loss of over $230 million worth of VDAs—about 45 per cent of the total crypto assets on the platform.
 
“This is just the beginning; we are fully committed to recovering the stolen funds, leaving no stone unturned to maximise recoveries under a scheme. We appreciate our users' patience and support as we navigate this challenging situation together,” said Nischal Shetty, founder, WazirX.
 
 
USDT, or Tether, is a type of cryptocurrency called a stablecoin. It maintains a stable value by being pegged to a fiat currency; in this case, the US dollar.
 
WazirX, whose parent company Zettai is based in Singapore, suffered a breach on its platform in July 2024. It applied for restructuring at a Singapore court on August 23. The company, facing liabilities amounting to $546.5 million, had a user base of over 16 million investors.

One of WazirX’s multisig, or multi-signature, wallets suffered a cyberattack, following which the company temporarily suspended most of its operations. The affected multisig wallet at the firm had six signatories: five managed by WazirX and one by Liminal Custody, a platform that services the crypto exchange’s wallets.
 
The cyberattack on the company was attributed to North Korea's notorious hacking organisation, Lazarus Group.</p>
